## Task
You've learned that you can add another component inside the App component, and then render that new component inside the App component's return statement.

In this exercise, you'll practice doing just that. You will be instructed, step by step, to build a new component inside the App component, and to have it rendered on the screen.

## Steps

#### Step 1

Add a new function to the App component, named **Heading .** 

Once this folder is open, locate the **src** folder, and inside of it, the **App.js** file. Click on the App.js file in the EXPLORER to have it open.

Now you're ready to add a new function to the App component, and name that function **Heading.** Place it at the very top of the **App.js** file.

#### Step 2
In the body of the **Heading** component, add a return statement.

#### Step 3
To the right of the **return** keyword, add the following JSX code: **<h1>This is an h1 heading</h1>**

#### Step 4

Save your changes and view the app in the browser.


Is this valid component code?

function Example() { return (<h1>Example</h1>) }
