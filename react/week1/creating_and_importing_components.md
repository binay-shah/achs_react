## Task

You've learned that you can export a component either as a default export or as a named export. You've also learned how to import such components. 

Let's demonstrate this with a basic example. In this exercise, you'll practice saving a component to its own file and importing it into its parent component so that it can be rendered on the screen.

## Steps

#### Step 1
Move the **Heading** function from App.js to a separate component file, named “Heading.js”. 

Also note that you can build a new file by right-clicking on the src folder, then in the right-click contextual menu that appears, clicking on the New File command.

After you've clicked the New File command, you'll need to type the file name and extension into the slot for the new file. You need to type in: Heading.js

Once you've typed Heading.js, press the ENTER key to finish the process of naming the file. Upon pressing the ENTER key, your new, empty Heading.js file will be shown, ready to be edited and updated with some code.

#### Step 2

Import the **Heading** component into the **App** component.

#### Step 3
Remove the sentence that reads: This is the starting code for “Your first component” ungraded lab - so that only the **Heading** JSX element remains in the return statement of the App component. 

#### Step 4
Save and view the app in the browser.
