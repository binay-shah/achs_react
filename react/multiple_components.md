## Task
You've learned that components in React allow for modularity and reuse, with the ability to make data more dynamic by passing it from the parent to the child using props.

In this exercise, you'll render one component multiple times, to practice using different props and observing what exactly "reusing" components means.

## Instructions
#### Step 1

This task's starting point is the App component's h1 element that reads: "Task: Add three Card elements". 

However, there is no Card component's JS file in this starting code. Therefore, the first task is to add a Card.js file, and inside of that file, declare a Card function.  

#### Step 2

Inside the Card.js file's Card function, add a return statement with two parentheses after it, to allow the return statement to spread onto several lines. 

#### Step 3

Inside the return statement, add a wrapping div element. 

#### Step 4

Inside the wrapping div element, add an h2 element, and under it, an h3 element. 

#### Step 5

Inside the h2 element you've already added, add the JSX expression of: {props.h2}. 

#### Step 6

Inside the h3 element you've already added, add the JSX expression of: {props.h3}. 

#### Step 7

Don't forget to add the line of code that reads export default Card at the very bottom of the Cards.js file.

#### Step 8

Back inside the App component, import the Card component. 

#### Step 9

Inside the App component's return statement, under the h1 element, add three <Card /> JSX elements. 

#### Step 10

Add the h2 prop to the first <Card /> element, like this: h2="First card's h2". 

#### Step 11

Add the h3 prop to the first <Card /> element, like this: h3="First card's h3". 

#### Step 12

Add the h2 and h3 props to the second <Card /> element, with the h2 reading: "Second card's h2", and the h3 reading "Second card's h3". 

#### Step 13

Add the h2 and h3 props to the third <Card /> element, with the h2 reading: "Third card's h2", and the h3 reading "Third card's h3". 

#### Step 14

Add the className attribute to the Card.js file's Card function's return statement's wrapping div element. 

#### Step 15

Save and view the app in the browser.
